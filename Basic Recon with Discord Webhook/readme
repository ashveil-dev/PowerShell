Get-Recon Script

The Get-Recon script is a PowerShell script that gathers information about the system's geolocation, network configuration, users, firewall status, antivirus information, and WiFi SSIDs and passwords. It then saves this information to a text file and optionally uploads it to a Discord channel using a webhook.
Usage

    Ensure you have PowerShell installed on your system.
    Copy the contents of the script and save them to a file with a .ps1 extension (e.g., GetRecon.ps1).

Dependencies

The script uses some PowerShell cmdlets that come with Windows by default:

    Invoke-RestMethod: Used to fetch geolocation information from the ip-api.com API.
    Get-WmiObject: Used to retrieve network configuration information.
    Get-NetFirewallProfile: Used to check the status of the firewall.
    Get-CimInstance: Used to get information about installed antivirus products.

Function: Get-Recon

This function performs the following tasks:

    Retrieves geolocation information (IP, country, region, city, latitude, longitude, timezone, and ISP) using the ip-api.com API.
    Retrieves network configuration information (private IP, subnet, default gateway, and DNS servers) using WMI.
    Lists all user accounts on the system.
    Checks the status of the firewall (enabled or disabled).
    Retrieves information about installed antivirus products.
    Lists the available WiFi SSIDs and passwords (requires a Get-Networks cmdlet, which is not defined in the script).

The collected information is saved to a text file named CaliLoot.txt in the system's temporary directory ($env:TEMP).
Function: Upload-Discord

This function allows you to upload the generated text file to a Discord channel using a webhook. It takes three parameters:

    $file: The path to the file that should be uploaded (e.g., "$env:TEMP\CaliLoot.txt").
    $text: A custom text message (optional) that will be sent along with the file.
    $webhookUrl: Your Discord webhook URL. Replace 'YOUR DISCORD WEBHOOK HERE' with the actual webhook URL to enable uploading to Discord.

Note: The script uses the Out-Null cmdlet when invoking Upload-Discord, which means the output won't be displayed in the console.
