# Wallpaper-Engine PowerShell Script README

## Introduction
`Wallpaper-Engine` is a PowerShell script designed to automate the process of launching your Steam Wallpaper Engine application without the need to start the Steam app. This script helps in setting up your wallpaper, preventing it from being just a black screen.

## Installation
To use this script, you can add `wallpaper_AUTO-cali.ps1` to your startup folder, the registry, or simply keep it on your desktop. Running the script is as simple as selecting the `wallpaper_AUTO-cali.ps1`.
Alternatively, execute `Run_on_BOOT.ps1` to automatically inject registry to auto-run Wallpaper Engine upon each computer boot (automatically run `wallpaper_AUTO-cali.ps1`)

## Usage
Once installed, the script will search for the `wallpaper64.exe` file in your system and launch it, thereby starting your Wallpaper Engine. This eliminates the need to manually start the Wallpaper Engine through Steam.

## Requirements
- PowerShell
- Steam Wallpaper Engine installed on your system
